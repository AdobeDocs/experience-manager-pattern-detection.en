`CDW`  Custom Dialog Widgets identifies the Coral and Classic custom dialog widgets. These must be updated for them to be compatible with AEM as a Cloud Service.

Subtypes are used to identify the different types of information, such as:

* `custom.coral.widget`: Identify the custom dialog widgets based on coral2/coral3.
* `custom.classic.widget`: Identify the custom dialog widgets based on ExtJs.

## Possible implications and risks {#implications-and-risks}

* The Classic UI is no longer available in AEM as a Cloud Service. The standard interface for authoring is the Touch-enabled UI.
