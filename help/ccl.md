Custom Client Library

## Background {#background}

`CCL` identifies client libraries which have been installed on AEM. This information is provided for the purposes of best practices assessment.

One subtype is used with this code:
* `custom.client.library`

## Possible implications and risks {#implications-and-risks}

* The client libraries which have been added to AEM should be reviewed to ensure that there is no duplication and that the latest versions are used.

## Possible solutions {#solutions}

* Please reach out to our [AEM Support Team](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/support-for-experience-cloud.html) to get clarifications or to address concerns.
