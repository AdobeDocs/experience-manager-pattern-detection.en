`CDW`  (`Custom Dialog Widgets`) Identifies the custom Classic Dialog Widgets. These widgets should be updated for them to be compatible with AEM as a Cloud Service.

Subtypes are used to identify the information, such as:

* `custom.classic.widget`: Identify the custom dialog widgets based on ExtJs.

## Possible implications and risks {#implications-and-risks}

* The Classic UI is no longer available in AEM as a Cloud Service. The standard interface for authoring is the Touch-enabled UI.
 
## Possible solutions {#solutions}

* Custom Classic Dialog Widgets should be converted from ExtJS to [CoralUI](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/6-5/coral-ui/coralui3/getting-started.html).
* Contact the [Experience Manager Customer Care Team](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/support-for-experience-cloud.html) for clarifications or to address concerns.
